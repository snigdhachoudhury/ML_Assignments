## 📌 Overview

Urban parking is a limited and highly demanded resource. Static pricing often leads to either overcrowding or underutilization. This project presents a **real-time dynamic pricing engine** for 14 urban parking lots using machine learning principles and basic economic theory — implemented **entirely from scratch** using only `numpy`, `pandas`, and **Pathway** for real-time simulation.

The system adjusts parking prices in real-time based on factors like:

- Occupancy and queue length
- Vehicle type
- Traffic congestion
- Special day indicators
- Nearby competitor prices (optional in Model 3)
